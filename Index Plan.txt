Hi, and welcome to my simple home page. This page is intended to be a 
top-level hub to link to my work in the INFT 1206: Web Development - 
Fundamentals course for the Winter 2024 term at Durham College.

Introduction

My name is Sarah, and I use she/her pronouns. I'm in my second term of 
the Computer Programming and Analysis program at Durham College, and 
I'm in my forties! It was a really big leap of faith to decide to go 
back to school after so long. But I'm confident in my ability to learn, 
and feel like I'm bringing a more mature focus to my learning that I 
wouldn't have had in my twenties.

That being said, I do somewhat regret not going to college or 
university in my twenties. Not straight after high school, though. I 
was way too immature back then and I would not have applied myself to 
my education.
