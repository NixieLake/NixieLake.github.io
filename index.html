      Hi, and welcome to my simple home page. This page is intended to be a top-level hub to link 
      to my work in the INFT 1206: Web Development - Fundamentals course for the Winter 2024 term 
      at Durham College.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      My name is Sarah, and I use she/her pronouns. I'm in my second term of the Computer 
      Programming and Analysis program at Durham College, and I'm in my forties! It was a really 
      big leap of faith to decide to go back to school after so long. But I'm confident in my 
      ability to learn, and feel like I'm bringing a more mature focus to my learning that I 
      wouldn't have had in my twenties.
    </p>
        
    <p>
      That being said, I do somewhat regret not going to college or university in my twenties. Not 
      straight after high school, though. I was way too immature back then and I would not have 
      applied myself to my education.
    </p>
