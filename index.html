            Hi, and welcome to my simple home page. This page is intended to be a top-level hub to 
            link to my work in the INFT 1206: Web Development - Fundamentals course for the Winter 
            2024 term at Durham College.
        </p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            My name is Sarah, and I use she/her pronouns. I'm in my second term of the Computer 
            Programming and Analysis program at Durham College, and I'm in my forties! It was a 
            really big leap of faith to decide to go back to school after so long. But I'm 
            confident in my ability to learn, and feel like I'm bringing a more mature focus to my 
            learning that I wouldn't have had in my twenties.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            That being said, I do somewhat regret not going to college or university in my 
            twenties. Not straight after high school, though. I was way too immature back then and 
            I would not have applied myself to my education.
        </p>
